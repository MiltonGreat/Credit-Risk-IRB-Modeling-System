# Credit-Risk-IRB-Modeling-System
This project implements a complete Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) modeling system for credit risk assessment, following Basel III regulatory standards. The system estimates Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) while emphasizing model explainability, fairness auditing, and regulatory compliance.
